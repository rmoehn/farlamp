% Paul's articles are in many places on the web. For the URL I use where I read
% the article. (Usually the Alignment Forum. Or on LessWrong, which is just a
% mirror. Or on GreaterWrong, which is another mirror.) For the date I use the
% original date, because using the Alignment Forum date would project a wrong
% timeline.
