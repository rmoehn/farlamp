% Paul's articles are in many places on the web. For the URL I use the version
% on the Alignment Forum, because that's where I read the article. (Or on
% LessWrong, which is just a mirror. Or on GreaterWrong, which is another
% mirror.) For the date I use the original date, because using the Alignment
% Forum date would project a wrong timeline.
